## Debugging Applications

*20 MINUTE EXERCISE*

In this lab you will debug the CoolStore application using Java remote debugging and 
look into line-by-line code execution as the code runs inside a container on OpenShift.

#### Investigate The Bug

CoolStore application seems to have a bug that causes the inventory status for one of the 
products not to be displayed in the web interface.

This is not an expected behavior! In previous labs, you added a circuit breaker to 
protect the CoolStore application from failures and in case the Inventory API is not 
available, to skip it and show the products without the inventory status. However, right 
now the inventory status is available for all products but one which is not how we 
expect to see the products.

Since the product list is provided by the API Gateway, take a look into the API Gateway 
logs to see if there are any errors:

----
$ oc logs dc/gateway -c vertx | grep -i "inventory error"

...
WARNING: Inventory error for 444436: status code 204
WARNING: Inventory error for 444436: status code 204
...
----

Oh! Something seems to be wrong with the response the API Gateway has received from the 
Inventory API for the product id **444436**. 

Look into the Inventory pod logs to investigate further and see if you can find more  
information about this bug:


----
$ oc logs dc/inventory -c thorntail-v2 | grep ERROR
----

There doesn't seem to be anything relevant to the **invalid response** error that the 
API Gateway received either! 

Invoke the Inventory API using `*curl*` for the suspect product id to see what actually 
happens when API Gateway makes this call:

IMPORTANT: You can find out the Inventory route url using `*oc get route inventory`. Replace 
IMPORTANT: **{{INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}}** with the Inventory route url from your project.

----
$ curl -v http://{{INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}}/api/inventory/444436
----

You received a ***HTTP/1.1 204 No Content*** response for the above request. Indeed, no response came back and that seems to be the reason the inventory status is not displayed on the web interface.

Let's debug the Inventory service to get to the bottom of this!

#### Enable Remote Debugging 

Remote debugging is a useful debugging technique for application development which allows 
looking into the code that is being executed somewhere else on a different machine and 
execute the code line-by-line to help investigate bugs and issues. Remote debugging is 
part of  Java SE standard debugging architecture which you can learn more about it in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/architecture.html[Java SE docs^].


The Java image on OpenShift has built-in support for remote debugging and it can be enabled 
by setting the ***JAVA_DEBUG=true*** environment variables on the deployment config for the pod 
that you want to remotely debug.

An easier approach would be to use the fabric8 maven plugin to enable remote debugging on 
the Inventory pod. It also forwards the default remote debugging port, 5005, from the 
Inventory pod to your workstation so simplify connectivity.

Enable remote debugging on Inventory by running the following command in the CodeReady Workspaces **Terminal** window:

----
$ oc rollout pause dc/inventory
$ oc set env dc/inventory JAVA_DEBUG=true
$ oc set env dc/inventory AB_PROMETHEUS_OFF-
$ oc set probe dc/inventory --readiness --liveness --remove
$ oc rollout resume dc/inventory
$ oc rollout latest dc/inventory
$ oc get pods -lapp=inventory,deploymentconfig=inventory
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-19-k54lj   1/1       Running   0          3m
----

Wait until the service is **Running** with **1/1** in the **READY** column.

IMPORTANT: The default port for remoting debugging is **5005** but you can change the default port 
IMPORTANT: via environment variables (JAVA_DEBUG_PORT). Read more in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift/reference#configuration_environment_variables[Java S2I Image docs^].

You are all set now to start debugging using the tools of you choice. 

Forward the remote debugging port of the Inventory service locally by executing the following command:

----
$ oc port-forward dc/inventory 5005
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5005 -> 5005
Forwarding from [::1]:5005 -> 5005
----

Do not wait for the command to return! It keeps the forwarded 
port open so that you can start debugging remotely.

#### Remote Debug with CodeReady Workspaces

CodeReady Workspaces provides a convenient way to remotely connect to Java applications running 
inside containers and debug while following the code execution in the IDE.

From the **Run** menu, click on **Edit Debug Configurations...**.

image:{% image_path debug-che-debug-config-1.png %}[Remote Debug,600]

The window shows the debuggers available in CodeReady Workspaces. Click on the plus sign near the 
Java debugger.

image:{% image_path debug-che-debug-config-2.png %}[Remote Debug,700]

Configure the remote debugger and click on the **Save** button:

* Check **Connect to process on workspace machine**
* Port: **5005**

image:{% image_path debug-che-debug-config-3.png %}[Remote Debug,700]

You can now click on the **Debug** button to make CodeReady Workspaces connect to the 
Inventory service running on OpenShift.

You should see a confirmation that the remote debugger is successfully connected.

image:{% image_path debug-che-debug-config-4.png %}[Remote Debug,360]

Open ***com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory.InventoryResource*** and `*click once
on the editor sidebar on the line number of the first line of the getAvailability() 
method*` to add a breakpoint to that line. A start appears near the line to show a breakpoint 
is set.

image:{% image_path debug-che-breakpoint.png %}[Add Breakpoint,600]

Open a new **Terminal** window and use `*curl*` to invoke the Inventory API with the 
suspect product id in order to pause the code execution at the defined breakpoint.

Note that you can use the the following icons to switch between debug and terminal windows.


image:{% image_path debug-che-window-guide.png %}[Icons,700]

IMPORTANT:  You can find out the Inventory route url using `*oc get routes`. Replace 
IMPORTANT: **{{INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}}** with the Inventory route url from your project.

----
$ curl -v http://{{INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}}/api/inventory/444436
----

Switch back to the debug panel and notice that the code execution is paused at the 
breakpoint on ***InventoryResource*** class.

image:{% image_path debug-che-breakpoint-stop.png %}[Icons,900]

Click on the _Step Over_ icon to execute one line and retrieve the inventory object for the 
given product id from the database.

image:{% image_path debug-che-step-over.png %}[Step Over,340]

Click on the the plus icon in the **Variables** panel to add the ***inventory*** variable 
to the list of watch variables. This would allow you to see the value of ***inventory*** variable 
during execution.

image:{% image_path debug-che-variables.png %}[Watch Variables,500]

image:{% image_path debug-che-breakpoint-values.png %}[Debug,900]

Can you spot the bug now? 

Look at the **Variables** window. The retrieved inventory object is ***null***!

The non-existing product id is not a problem on its own because it simply could mean 
this product is discontinued and removed from the Inventory database but it's not 
removed from the product catalog database yet. The bug is however caused because 
the code returns this ***null*** value instead of a sensible REST response. If the product 
id does not exist, a proper JSON response stating a zero inventory should be 
returned instead of ***null***.

`Click on the _Resume_ icon*` to continue the code execution and then on the stop icon to 
end the debug session.

#### Fix the Inventory Bug

Edit the ***InventoryResource.java*** and update the ***getAvailability()*** to make it look like the following 
code in order to return a zero inventory for products that don't exist in the inventory 
database:

----
@GET
@Path("/{itemId}")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public Inventory getAvailability(@PathParam("itemId") String itemId) {
    Inventory inventory = em.find(Inventory.class, itemId);

    if (inventory == null) {
        inventory = new Inventory();
        inventory.setItemId(itemId);
        inventory.setQuantity(0);
    }

    return inventory;
}
----

Go back to the **Terminal** window where `*oc port-forward*` was running. Press 
`Ctrl+C*` to stop the debug and port-forward and then run the following commands 
to commit the changes to the Git repository.

----
$ git add src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/inventory/InventoryResource.java
$ git commit -m "inventory returns zero for non-existing product id" 
$ git push origin master
----

As soon as you commit the changes to the Git repository, the ***inventory-pipeline*** gets 
triggered to build and deploy a new Inventory container with the fix. Go to the 
OpenShift Web Console and inside the **{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}** project. On the sidebar 
menu, `*click on 'Builds >> Pipelines'*` to see its progress.

When the pipeline completes successfully, point your browser at the Web route and verify 
that the inventory status is visible for all products. The suspect product should show 
the inventory status as _Not in Stock_.
