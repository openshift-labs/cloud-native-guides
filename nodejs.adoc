## Web UI with Node.js and AngularJS 

In this section you will learn about Node.js and will deploy the Node.js and Angular-based 
web UI for services deployed in the previous labs.

#### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side 
applications using JavaScript. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of 
non-blocking I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in 
Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time web applications.

Node.js non-blocking architectures allows applications to process large number of 
requests (tens of thousands) using a single thread which makes ia desirable choice for building 
scalable web applications.

#### Deploy Web UI on OpenShift

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side 
JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the ceritifed Node.js container image available 
in OpenShift. 

In the previous labs, you used the OpenShift 
{{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)] 
feature via the https://maven.fabric8.io[Fabric8 Maven Plugin] to build a container image from the 
source code on your laptop. In this lab, you will still use S2I but instead instruct OpenShift 
to obtain the application code directly from the source repository and build and deploy a 
container image of it.

The source code for the the Node.js Web component is available in this Git repository: {{WEB_NODEJS_GIT_REPO}}

First, make sure you are on the  `{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}` project:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc project {{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}
----

Use the OpenShift CLI command to create a new build and deployment for the Web component:

TIP: Feeling adventureous? Build and deploy the Web component via the OpenShift Web Console 
instead. To give you a hint, start by clicking on *Add to project* within the `coolstore` project.


[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-app nodejs~{{LABS_GIT_REPO}} --context-dir=projects/web-nodejs --name=web --labels=app=coolstore
----

A build gets created and starts building the Node.js Web UI container image. You can see the build 
logs using OpenShift Web Console or OpenShift CLI:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc logs -f bc/web
----

The `-f` option is to follow the logs as the build progresses. After the building the Node.s Web UI 
completes, it gets pushed into the internal image registry in OpenShift and then deployed within 
your project.

In order to access the Web UI from outside (e.g. from a browser), it needs to get added to the load 
balancer. Run the following command to add the Web UI service to the built-in HAProxy load balancer 
in OpenShift.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc expose svc/web

route "web" exposed
----

Get the route urls for Web UI:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get routes

NAME        HOST/PORT                                                  PATH      SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   
catalog     catalog-coolstore.roadshow.openshiftapps.com               catalog     8080                     None
gateway     gateway-coolstore.roadshow.openshiftapps.com               gateway     8080                     None
inventory   inventory-coolstore.roadshow.openshiftapps.com             inventory   8080                     None
web         web-coolstore.roadshow.openshiftapps.com                   web         8080                     None
----

CAUTION: The route urls in your project would be different from the ones in this lab guide! Use the one from yor project.

Now point your browser at the Web UI route url. You should be able to see the CoolStore with all 
products and their inventory status.

[TIP]
====
Currently the `fabric8-maven-plugin` has a 
https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/issues/742[bug] 
that prevents grouping the pods properly. Run the following 
tweak to assign an `app` label to deployment configs and group them 
together in the OpenShift Web Console

[source,bash]
----
$ oc label dc app=coolstore --all --overwrite

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
